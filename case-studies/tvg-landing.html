      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I built a responsive marketing page to explain how Ticket VeriGuard keeps listings in sync so the same seat cannot sell twice. 
        The page focuses on clear messaging, trust, and a direct path into the live demo.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          When sellers list the same seats on multiple marketplaces, duplicate sales lead to chargebacks, angry fans at the gate, and damaged marketplace trust. 
          The concept needs to be communicated simply before diving into integration details.
